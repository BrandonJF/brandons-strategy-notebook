# Brandon's Strategy Notebook

A comprehensive framework for creating rigorous strategic arguments and decisions, built on mathematical proof principles and systems thinking.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete strategic analysis methodology designed to eliminate the gaps between intuition-based decisions and evidence-based strategic reasoning. The framework ensures decisions are grounded in evidence, logic, and testable validation rather than assumptions or wishful thinking.

## Core Components

### üìã [Strategic Proof Framework](strategic_proof_framework.md)
The foundational methodology for creating logically sound strategic arguments. Based on mathematical proof principles and systems thinking, it provides:

- **Systems Thinking Foundation**: Map your operating environment, then navigate it optimally
- **Capital Optimization Focus**: Treat all resources (time, money, relationships, expertise) as finite capital requiring smart allocation
- **Integrated Logical Flow**: Everything connects through premise indicators (SINCE/THEREFORE/GIVEN)
- **Strategic Test-Driven Development**: Validate every claim with measurable if-then tests

**Key Sections:**
- Proposition construction and quality standards
- Definitions purity requirements (concept clarification only)
- Constraint classification (IMMUTABLE/CURRENT/CHOSEN) 
- Logical argument chain patterns
- Strategic validation methodology
- Quality assessment frameworks

### üîç [Strategic Proof Evaluation Prompt](strategic_proof_evaluation_prompt.md)
A comprehensive AI evaluation system for analyzing strategic documents using the framework. Provides:

- **Enhanced Annotation System**: Standardized format for identifying logical flaws, evidence gaps, and structural weaknesses
- **Mode-Specific Workflows**: Tailored approaches for EVALUATION, CONVERSION, BUILDING, and REFINEMENT tasks
- **Quality Control Standards**: Systematic checklists and self-verification processes
- **User Interaction Management**: Guidelines for handling disagreement, uncertainty, and iterative improvement

**Key Features:**
- 15+ annotation categories with complete sentence requirements
- Systematic evaluation workflows for different document types
- Confidence calibration and professional interaction standards
- Integration testing between framework components

### ü§ñ [Strategic Framework Maintainer](.claude/agents/strategic-framework-maintainer.md)
Specialized AI subagent for maintaining framework consistency and effectiveness:

- Framework-prompt alignment verification
- Annotation system enhancements
- Quality standard improvements
- Integration testing and systematic updates

## Framework Philosophy

### Strategic vs Tactical Clarity
- **Strategic Focus**: Justifying CHOICES first, with tactical elements acceptable after strategic justification
- **Systems Navigation**: Optimal path through constraints and dynamics over time
- **Capital Optimization**: Smart allocation of finite resources within system constraints
- **Evidence-Based**: Prove what you know, acknowledge what you don't

### Core Principles
1. **Intellectual Honesty**: Force explicit validation of claims vs assumptions
2. **Logical Rigor**: Valid reasoning without fallacies or logical leaps
3. **Testability**: All claims must be validatable with specific test designs
4. **Systems Thinking**: Map environment before choosing strategic path
5. **Capital Efficiency**: Optimize scarce resource allocation across time

## Usage Examples

### Strategic Decision Documents
Examples of framework application to real strategic decisions:

- **[AI Policy Strategic Proof Example](ai_policy_strategic_proof_example.md)**: Clean example demonstrating framework application to policy and governance decisions
- **[AI Policy Strategic Proof ANNOTATED EXEMPLAR](ai_policy_strategic_proof_ANNOTATED_EXEMPLAR.md)**: Comprehensive evaluation showing annotation standards and framework compliance analysis

### Common Use Cases
- Resource allocation decisions within system constraints
- Market positioning with temporal dynamics
- Capability development strategy over time
- Risk/uncertainty management approaches
- Alternative comparison and optimization

## Getting Started

### How to Use with Claude Projects

**For AI-Assisted Strategic Analysis:**

1. **Create a Claude Project** for your strategic work
2. **Add System Instructions**: Copy the contents of [strategic_proof_evaluation_prompt.md](strategic_proof_evaluation_prompt.md) into your project's system instructions
3. **Upload Framework Files** to your project knowledge base:
   - `strategic_proof_framework.md` (core methodology)
   - `ai_policy_strategic_proof_ANNOTATED_EXEMPLAR.md` (evaluation standards reference)
4. **Upload Your Strategic Documents** that need analysis or improvement

**Claude will then be able to:**
- Evaluate existing strategic documents using the Enhanced Annotation System
- Help convert other documents into Strategic Proof Framework format
- Guide you through building new strategic proofs from scratch
- Provide systematic quality control and improvement suggestions
- Apply the same rigorous standards demonstrated in the annotated exemplar

### Manual Framework Application

### 1. Understand the Framework
Start with [strategic_proof_framework.md](strategic_proof_framework.md) to understand:
- When to use the framework (strategic choices, not tactical execution)
- Core structure (Proposition ‚Üí Definitions ‚Üí Constraints ‚Üí Logic Chain ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Conclusion)
- Systems thinking and capital optimization principles

### 2. Learn the Evaluation System
Review [strategic_proof_evaluation_prompt.md](strategic_proof_evaluation_prompt.md) for:
- Annotation standards and quality requirements
- Evaluation workflows for different task types
- Quality control and self-verification processes

### 3. Apply to Your Decisions
Use the framework template structure for strategic choices:
```markdown
## PROPOSITION
Given [constraints], [initiative] is the optimal path to achieve [outcome] within [timeframe].

## DEFINITIONS
**[Key Term]:** [Pure concept clarification only]

## CONSTRAINTS
### IMMUTABLE CONSTRAINTS (Fixed System Properties)
### CURRENT CONSTRAINTS (Current System Position)  
### CHOSEN CONSTRAINTS (Strategic System Boundaries)

## LOGICAL ARGUMENT CHAIN
### SINCE [fundamental constraint/system property]
### GIVEN [current system position/context]
### WE CHOOSE [approach] OVER [alternatives] BECAUSE
### THEREFORE WE WILL VALIDATE BY ACHIEVING

## CONCLUSION
[Synthesis + quality assessment + limitations]
```

## Quality Standards

### Annotation System
All analysis uses standardized backtick annotations with complete sentence explanations:
- `[LOGICAL GAP: Complete sentence explaining missing reasoning step]`
- `[ASSUMPTION: Complete sentence explaining validation needed]`
- `[VALIDATED: STRONG/WEAK - Complete sentence explaining evidence quality]`
- `[ERROR: Complete sentence explaining factual/mathematical/logical mistake]`

### Framework Compliance
- **Definitions Purity**: No strategic arguments or validation annotations in definitions
- **Integrated Flow**: All content connected through logical argument chain
- **Strategic Scope**: Choice justification before tactical execution
- **Systems Focus**: Navigation through constraints and dynamics over time
